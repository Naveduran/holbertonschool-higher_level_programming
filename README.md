# High level programming
I created a complete web service with databases, back-end, and an amazing front-end
website with the latest technologies. This project gave me all the skills to work in  companies in Silicon Valley such as Facebook or Dropbox. I gained skills to
quickly learn and adapt to new frameworks for building products or to iterate on an existing codebase.
